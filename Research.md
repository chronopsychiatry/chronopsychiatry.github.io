<h3> Main themes</h3>

<h5> Adolescent mental health </h5>
<ul>
<li> Methods development in schools </li>
<li> Sleep, cognitive function and mood</li>
<li> Fitbit and mental health data </li>
<li> Autism, sleep and mental health </li>
</ul>

<h5> Data science</h5>
We are also developing methods that make use of FitBit data from the [ABCD cohort](https://abcdstudy.org/) to invetsiagte sleep and circadian parameters as predictors of depression-related outcomes in young people in the United States. This work builds on our experience with actigraphy data in SCRAMS and within the UK Biobank cohort.


<h5> Neuroimaging</h5>
<ul>
<li> Sleep and brain structure</li>
</ul>

<h5> Genomics</h5>
<ul>
<li> Variation in core circadian network (CCN) genes and risk of depression/bipolar disorder</li>
</ul>
